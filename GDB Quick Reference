Some cool things you can do with gdb:


Two ways to launch:

gdb <path to the executable>

gdb -tui <path to the executable>
: TUI stands for terminal user interface


Once in, You can type:

layout split  ->  to see the code as well as assembly code view.
b <name of a function>    -> insert breakpoint at a function
b <file name>:line number -> create breakpoint at the given line number in a given file.
n                         -> execute 1 line
step                      -> step into the function if control is at the line with a function call.
                            (what happens if there are more than one function call in a line?
                             No idea :)
run                       -> Run until the next break point
c                         -> Should also do the same (There may be some difference wrt run; don't know what it is.)
